          <h1>Statement of Purpose</h1>
          <p>
            Mighty Oaks Enrichment Center exists to provide fun, hands on,
            supplemental classes to assist families in the home education of
            their children. All subjects are taught with a Christ-centered
            Biblical perspective. We believe that God loves all people and He
            has a purpose and a plan for the life of each individual. Our goal
            is to encourage, support, and help equip each student as they seek
            that purpose and develop their skills to fulfill God's plan for
            their lives.

          <h1>Statement of Faith</h1>
          <ul>
            <li>
              We believe the Bible is the inspired, inerrant, and authoritative
              Word of God.
              <br />
              <strong>(2 Timothy 3:16-17; 2 Peter 1:19-21)</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              We believe in a literal, grammatical-historical interpretation of
              the Bible, and accept the historical record of the Bible as
              accurate. This includes the account of creation in Genesis 1.
            </li>
            <li>
              We believe there is one God eternally existing in three persons:
              Father, Son and Holy Spirit.

              >
            </li>
            <li>
              We believe that Jesus Christ is God Himself, came to earth in the
              flesh, was born of a virgin, and lived a sinless life. He died a
              substitutionary and atoning death on the cross. He arose bodily
              from the grave and ascended into heaven where He presently sits at
              the right hand of God.

            <li>
              We believe that the Holy Spirit convicts the world of sin and
              leads and guides believers into truth. He indwells believers
              permanently, seals them unto the day of redemption, and bestows
              spiritual gifts upon them.

            <li>
              We believe mankind is created in God's image, as male or female,
              and that an individual's gender corresponds with his or her
              God-given biological gender. Further, being descended from Adam,
              all mankind inherits a sinful nature and is totally unable to save
              themselves from the natural consequences of sin.
              <br />

                >(Genesis 1:27; 3; Psalm 139:14; Acts 4:12; Romans 1:18-32;
                5:10-19; Ephesians 2:1-2)</strong
              >
            </li>
            <li>
              We believe that salvation is the gift of God's grace given to all
              who "call upon the name of the Lord". It cannot be gained by good
              works, but is a free gift for all who put their trust in Jesus
              Christ and His finished work on the cross. All who trust in Jesus
              Christ as Savior and Lord are forgiven and saved from their sins
              and made righteous before God and given the right to be called His
              children.
